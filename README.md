# Project Title: Golden Wheat Bakery - Full-Stack Web Application

## Project Overview:

The Golden Wheat Bakery is a beloved local bakery known for its handcrafted artisan bread, delectable pastries, and savory buns, all made using traditional baking methods and high-quality ingredients. As part of their plan to expand their business and improve customer engagement, the bakery has decided to establish a stronger online presence. This project involves the creation of a full-stack web application that will serve as the bakery’s official website, offering customers an intuitive and engaging platform to browse and purchase products, as well as learn more about the bakery’s offerings.

The website will feature a product catalog with detailed descriptions, an online ordering system, a wishlist feature and an easy-to-navigate interface. It will also include a section for customer reviews, a store locator, and contact information to help customers easily connect with the bakery.
